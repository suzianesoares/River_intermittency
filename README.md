# River intermittency

## Overview

This repository contains the R code and processed datasets used to model and visualize water presence in the riverbed of the Umbuzeiro River (Brazil) using three different models:

**Model a (Sentinel-2)** – using dynamic predictors based on Sentinel-derived data.

**Model b (Planetscope)** – using dynamic predictors based on Planetscope-derived data.

**Model c (Precipitation)** – using dynamic predictors based on precipitation.

The repository allows reproduction of all figures and analyses presented in the associated publication, including temporal proportions and spatial distribution of water presence.
